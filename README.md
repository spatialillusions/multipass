# Converting files to "multipass" files

A multipass file is a file that can be used as multiple fileformats by changing the file extension. Initially created to move data in and out of ATAK. https://github.com/deptofdefense/AndroidTacticalAssaultKit-CIV

1. For ATAK/WinTAK use MBTILES files
2. For ArcGIS use GPKG files

So if you get a file that is called file.mbtiles.gpkg and want to use it in ATAK/WinTAK rename it to file.mbtiles, if you want to use it in ArcGIS rename it to file.gpkg.


# Using the different scripts

- Install QGIS and open OSGeo4W Shell
- If you need to change from C: to another drive, type the drive letter and press enter, for example "G:" ENTER
- Navigate to the folder where you have your scripts by typing "CD folder"

(All scripts creates a copy of the original file that the operations are made on so you won't have to be afraid to make break anything)
